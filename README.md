## Description

Shape Shine is a community designed to empower healthy lifestyles and Improve that self-esteem and confidence on our commuters. By offering a database working on the server side of the project [Link to the Repo here](https://github.com/maferadr/shape-shine.git) with all workouts routines and meals, the user will have access to an organized plan to balance either their workouts and meal preps by signing up.

## Dificulties

- Deployment to EC2 Instance.
    After creating the S3 Bucket to store all the database tables that were working through the server side of the project (displayed on the recover repo), the deployment was struggling at not reading all the server side set up in the database.

- Server side of the Application not read in the Deployment Process.
    After setting up the AWS and DynamoDB instances on the application, the server side was not able to run properly at the time of the deployment. Therefore, the client side was separated and set up in a different repository to at least have the frontend code displayed.
